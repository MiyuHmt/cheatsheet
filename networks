## Networking topologies

Types of physical network topologies

* Bus topology
* Star topology
* Ring topology
* Mesh topology
* Tree topology
* Hybrid topology

### Bus topology

Bus topology is a network type in which every computer and network device is connected to single cable. When it has exactly two endpoints, then it is called Linear Bus topology.

In the bus network topology, every workstation is connected to a main cable called the bus. Therefore, in effect, each workstation is directly connected to every other workstation in the network.

In the Cable required is least compared to other network topology.

### Star topology

### Ring topology

### Mesh topology

### Tree topology

### Hybrid topology
