## Networking topologies

Types of physical network topologies:

* Bus topology
* Star topology
* Ring topology
* Mesh topology
* Tree topology
* Hybrid topology

### Bus topology

Bus topology is a network type in which every computer and network device is connected to single cable. When it has exactly two endpoints, then it is called Linear Bus topology.

In the bus network topology, every workstation is connected to a main cable called the bus. Therefore, in effect, each workstation is directly connected to every other workstation in the network.

In the Cable required is least compared to other network topology.

### Star topology

In the star network topology, thiere is a central computer or server to which all the workstations are directly connected.
Every workstation is indirectly connected to every other through the central computer.

In this type of topology all the computers are connected to a single hub through a cable.

This hub is the central node and all others nodes are connected to the central node.

### Ring topology

It is called ring topology because it forms a ring as each computer is connected to another computer, with the last one connected to the first. Exactly two neighbours for each device.

In the ring network topology, the workstations are connected in a closed loop configuration. Adjacent pairs of workstations are directly connected.

Other pairs of workstations are indirectly connected, the data passing through one or more intermediate nodes.

### Mesh topology

It is a point-to-point connection to other nodes or devices. All the network nodes are connected to each other. Mesh has n(n-2)/2 physical channels to link n devices.

The mesh network topology employs either of two schemes, called full mesh and partial mesh. In the full mesh topology, each workstations is connected directly to each of the others.

### Tree topology

### Hybrid topology
